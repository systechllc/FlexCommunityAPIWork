This is a very simple C# program that opens the UDP port
used for radio discovery and receives the packets.

This is very similar to the C++ version but done in C#

This does not use the FlexAPI at all and like the C++ program
does nothing really useful with the packets except display them
in listbox.

I used VS2015 to create this.
