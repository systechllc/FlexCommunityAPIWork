Johan PA3AIN has contributed this smaller version of his Flex control program.

This program uses the FlexLib API and compiles and runs in VS2015.  It requires
as said above the FlexLib API.  I've provided built versions of the DLLs in the 
libs directory with this checkout.

Thank you Johan.  Everyone, enjoy!
